% BATCH ANALYSIS FOR REPLAY CONTROL FOR 1 LAP TRACK
% MH_2020
% For 1 lap session, this code takes each lap from T1, calculate it's place fields and compares it to T2 1 LAP (e.g. ratemaps Lap 5 T1 vs Lap1 T2).
% Then it used these new place fields to decode replay events, and runs the same shuffle analysis as for normal data.
% In this control, both the replay events and good cells will be changed, by replacing the T1 good cells for the new T1 good cells (which will be
% good cells after running X laps, where X is the same amount of laps run in T2). That means that replay events won't be including cells that will
% only appear in later laps in T1. This control tries to simulate what would have happened if there was the same number of laps in both tracks.
