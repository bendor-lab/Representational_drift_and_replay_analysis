% Extract theta cycles peaks and troughs
% SD, 2020
% Select from two methods:
    % 1st - MATLAB FUNCTION
    % 2nd - Manual extraction
% OUTPUT: a matrix for peaks and troughs information. 1st column: indices of peaks/troughs; 2nd column: local max or local min; 3rd col: index for
% peak (1) or trough (-1); 4th coulmn: timestamps of each peak/trough (based on CSC time)
